## ‚ú® **Problem Statement: Crafting a CSV Importer for Google Sheets** ‚ú®

**Context**:
Data analysts around the world üåç, handle massive amounts of data to derive meaningful insights for their organization üìä. Among the tools they use, Google Sheets üìà stands out due to its ease of use, accessibility, and collaborative features. However, many analysts have identified a recurring pain point: the cumbersome process of importing CSV files into Google Sheets repeatedly.

A typical week of an analyst in an e-commerce company üõí involves receiving multiple CSV files üìÅ containing sales, inventory, customer feedback, and more. The data from these files needs to be meticulously analyzed and presented in the company‚Äôs weekly meetings. However, instead of diving directly into analysis, most analysts need to spend an inordinate amount of time just importing and structuring these CSV files into Google Sheets ‚è≥. This repetitive, time-consuming task reduces the efficiency of these professionals and delays the extraction of crucial insights üò´.

**Problem Statement**:
Make a CSV Importer for Google Sheets that lets users drag and drop CSV files onto the Google Sheet. The moment they drop the CSV file import.
